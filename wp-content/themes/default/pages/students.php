		<h2>We help you get better grades in your University of Florida classes with less time spent studying.</h2>
		<p>Stressed about your upcoming midterms? Still can't seem to get the hang of supply vs. demand curves? Or just really need to get that "A" in organic chemistry to get into med school? We can help! By offering live review sessions right across from campus, video content and study guides specific to your professor and delivering it to you 24/7 through our Facebook, iPhone/iPad, and Android apps, we've developed the best way for college students to increase their understanding of course material and perform better on exams.</p>
		<p>Currently, we cover "historically difficult" courses in 25 individual subjects such as chemistry, economics, mathematics, accounting, and physics. On top of that, many of the courses we cover are "gatekeeper courses," or ones that students must pass in order to pursue a particular major.</p>
